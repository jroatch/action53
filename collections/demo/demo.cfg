The screenshot frame in the
current version of Action 53
was based on a TV belonging
to NovaSquirrel, made by
Sharp. That was the TV that
I had in front of me while
making the menu software.

I could have modeled it after
a more iconic bezel if I
knew of one. What TV model
is tokumaru's suggested
frame based on?
